        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A dosa is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and
            rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew). Dosas are popular
            in South Asia as well as around the world.</p>
        <p>A mixture of rice and white gram that has been soaked in water for at least 4–5 hours is ground finely to
            form a batter. Some add a bit of soaked fenugreek seeds while grinding the batter. The proportion of rice to
            lentils is generally 3:1 or 4:1. After adding salt, the batter is allowed to ferment overnight, before being
            mixed with water to get the desired consistency. The batter is then ladled onto a hot tava or griddle
            greased with oil or ghee. It is spread out with the base of a ladle or a bowl to form a pancake. It can be
            made either thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy. A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled
            like a wrap. It is usually served with chutney and sambar. The mixture of white grams and rice can be
            replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Urad dal</li>
            <li>Methi seeds</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak Rice and Dal: In separate bowls, soak 2 cups of rice and ½ cup of urad dal with ½ teaspoon of fenugreek seeds in enough water for about 4-6 hours.</li>
            <li>Grind: Drain the soaked rice and dal. First, grind the urad dal and fenugreek seeds to a smooth paste, adding water as needed. Then, grind the rice to a smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>Mix and Ferment: Combine the ground rice and dal batter in a large bowl. Add salt to taste and mix well. Cover the bowl and let it ferment overnight or for about 8-12 hours in a warm place until it rises and becomes bubbly.</li>
            <li>Heat the Griddle: Heat a non-stick tawa or griddle over medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil or ghee.</li>
            <li>Spread the Batter: Pour a ladleful of the fermented dosa batter onto the center of the tawa. Using the back of the ladle, spread the batter in a circular motion to form a thin, even dosa.</li>
            <li>Cook: Drizzle a few drops of oil or ghee around the edges of the dosa. Cook until the edges start to lift, and the bottom becomes golden brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Flip or Fold: If you prefer a crisp dosa, you can cook just on one side. For a softer dosa, flip it and cook the other side for a few seconds.</li>
        </ol>
